# React + Vite

Will be doing some basic of Context api
Basically it is a solution of Prop Drilling(passing property unnecessary to child)
Problem with Prop Drilling is it looks very messy and unreadable
It works in three steps
- Define the context
- Provide the context in parent
- Use useContext hook to access


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
